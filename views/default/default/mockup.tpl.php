					<h1>Title of the page</h1>
					<p class="chapo">I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. It doesn't look so shiny to me. [sarcastically] Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Shut up and get to the point! Hey, whatcha watching? So, how 'bout them Knicks? Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.</p>
					<blockquote>I don't want to be rescued. Of all the friends I've had... you're the first. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. I can explain. It's very valuable. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. </blockquote>

Shut up and get to the point! Hey, whatcha watching? So, how 'bout them Knicks? Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.</p>
					<p>I had more, but you go ahead. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. But I've never been to the moon!</p>
					<p><a href="img/images/img2-big.jpg" class="fancybox"><img class="picture right" src="img/images/img2.jpg" /></a>Yes! In your face, Gandhi! And then the battle's not so bad? It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p>
					<pre>&lt;html>&lt;body>Code ici&lt;/body>&lt;/html></pre>
					<p>Of all the friends I've had... you're the first. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.</p>

									<p>Ask her how her day was. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. I don't want to be rescued. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. What kind of a father would I be if I said no?</p>

									<h3>Title 3</h3>
									<p>Daddy Bender, we're hungry. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?</p>

									<p>You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh... also, comes with double prize money. Take me to your leader! Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!</p>

									<p>I can explain. It's very valuable. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Ummmâ€¦to eBay? I had more, but you go ahead.  Anyone who laughs is a communist! You guys go on without me! I'm going to go... look for more stuff to steal! I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. </p>

									<p>You can see how I lived before I met you. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up!

If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch.</p>
